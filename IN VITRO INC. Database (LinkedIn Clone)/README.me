🏢 IN VITRO INC. Database (LinkedIn Replication)

📌 Overview

This project contains the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) database for IN VITRO INC., a new social media platform designed for Canadian entrepreneurs seeking joint business ventures. The database structure is modeled similarly to LinkedIn but includes unique modifications to fit the platform’s requirements.

📂 Contents

The database setup is divided into three main sections:

1️⃣ Create Tables (DDL) – Defines the structure of the database, including users, connections, experiences, and other necessary components.
2️⃣ Insert Data (DML) – Populates the database with synthetic test data to facilitate development and testing.
3️⃣ Queries to Perform on the Database – Example SQL queries to extract insights and test database functionality.

🏗️ Background

IN VITRO INC. is a social media platform targeting Canadian entrepreneurs interested in business partnerships.
The database is designed for testing and development purposes, requiring synthetic user and business data.
It does not include storage for bilingual data labels, as translations are handled externally.
